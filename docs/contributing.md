### How can I help contribute to howdoi?

If you would like to add or extend existing functionality, fix a bug or anything inbetween please follow the standard procedure for most open source projects. i.e:

1. First check the issues to see if anyone is working on your issue before starting work yourself. Someone else might be working on it already or a maintainer might've closed the issue as they don't feel it would be beneficial t the project.
2. Submit the issue on the repo and begin your work on your fork of the repo.
3. Submit your PR once completed and wait for feedback.
