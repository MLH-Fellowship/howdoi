### How can I help contribute to howdoi?

If you would like to add or extend existing functionality, fix a bug or anything inbetween please follow the standard procedure for most open source projects. i.e:

1. First check the issues to see if anyone is working on your issue before starting work yourself. Someone else might be working on it already or a maintainer might've closed the issue as they don't feel it would be beneficial to the project.
2. Submit the issue on the repo and begin your work on your fork of the repo.
3. Submit your PR once completed and wait for feedback.
